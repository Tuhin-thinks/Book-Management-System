# Book-Management-System
A desktop app for book management system using PyQt5 model view programming.

## Packages required to install

    Q. How to run this project?
```python
python3 launcher.py
```

For people running this on windows, you can get the Ubuntu feel on the UI, you can run this with:
```python
python launcher.py --posix
```

## What is the purpose of the project?

I made this project to be used by people keeping their e-books or study materials (I mean the actual ones) in some folder.
But later they can't remember where a certail category of book can be found.
    
    Or what are the books related to database management that he saved!
    or, what are the Python books that he have in his computer inside a certain directory?

So, this software **(in its later stages)** will try to search the book title online from a directory (recursive search) and try to label it.
**Provided title should be relevant. Everything depends on the title!**

** you can find the GUI design inside the */Lib/UI* folder.
